# oncrawlR

### Description

This R package implements methods for querying SEO data from oncrawlR using its API.

This API uses a basic authentication with an API key. 

NB : To get this API key, you need to have a Oncrawl [Business plan](https://www.oncrawl.com/pricing-crawler/).

The script is explained step by step on my blog post "[Guide complet de lâ€™API OncrawlR (package)](https://data-seo.com)"


## Install
```

```

## Getting started
